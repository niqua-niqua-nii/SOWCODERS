    <h2> <u>Our Mission</U> </h2>
        <p> We here at the Antigua Employment Agency, seek to find suitable and rewarding jobs for recent graduates of a tertiary educational program,
          dependent on the students strengths and qualifications. We also seek to equip places of employments with a solid and capable workforce
          in order to maximize profit and to help lower unemployment rates.</p>
    <h3>Why are we so invested in providing jobs for graduates?</h3>

      <p>Take a look at the video below, which speaks about unemployment rates.</p>

      <p>Despite our world becoming more accessible in terms of medicine and technological pursuits, unemployment still persists, especially in younger persons.
        A recent study indicate that 30% of recent graduates weren't able to find a job within a year a year of graduating, much less one relating to their major.
         We want to cut the middle man and link these individuals to a job, quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>At AEA we seek to lower the rates of unemployment island-wide and work forward to
          a more productive society. Our team is dedicated to finding the best
          job opportunities and best employees for the individual job-seeker or company.</p>
          <p>We understand how hard it is to find a job, especially just coming out of school and we seek to assist in the best way we can.</P>
